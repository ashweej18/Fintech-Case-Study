## **Overview & Origin**

Today, it's unlikely that someone hasn't learned about cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, according to investopedia is a digital (virtual) currency protected through cryptography, making it impossible to counterfeit or double spend. Generally, cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology –a distributed ledger maintained on decentralized network of computers on the internet. Cryptocurrencies are distinct from fiat money, in that they are not issued by Central Banks and thus could be immune to government interference.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD),also known as the bellwether of the cryptocurrency industry, has grown from $1000 in 2015 to $ 56,000 today. This has piqued the interest of main street investors, creating the need for trading platforms.

 ### **Competition**

 There are two types of cryptocurrency exchanges – Centralized Exchange and Decentralized Exchange.

 **Centralized Exchanges** are most common type. Most popular among them are  Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini. These exchanges require registration and adhere to KYC guidelines. Generally these exchanges, have active trading, high volumes and liquidity. As servers are centralized, these exchange can become target of attack and can be subject to Government intervention or regulation

**Decentralized Exchange**, as the name suggests, have no central location and have servers spread across the world. Hence, they are unlikely to be vector of cyber attack. These exchanges offer anonymity to its users and are free to use the platform in any manner they choose.

It is estimated that there are over 500+ cryptoexchanges in the world, out which about 310 are tracked on coinmarketcap. Crypto exchange business is characterized by low barrier of entry, low switching cost for customers and low differentiation among participants. As the market matures, we can expect the reduction of trading fees and consolidation among the cryptoexchanges.
